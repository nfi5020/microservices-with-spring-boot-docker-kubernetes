Steps to follow to build images using google jib: 
1. Add the below configuration in the pom.xml file 

      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
        <artifactId>jib-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.4.0</version>
        <configuration>
          <to>
            <image>myimage</image>
          </to>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>

2. Run the maven command "mvn compile jib:dockerBuild" from the location where pom.xml is present to generate the dokcer image without the need of Dockerfile. 
# One cool advantage of the google jib is it doesn't requrie docker to be installed in my system. 
Build and push in the docker hub without docker present (mvn clean jib:build)
- "mvn clean jib:build"

Build to Docker daemon (mvn clean jib:dockerBuild)
- "mvn clean jib:dockerBuild"

3. Execute the docker command "docker run -d -p 9000:9000 najrulbiplob/cards:s4". This will pull the image if not present and expose our application in port 9000.
